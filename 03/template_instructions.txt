[STEP] I want to create an Excel template. I'll provide you with all the options to include in the template, and when I have finished, you'll format it as an .xlsx file. 

[STEP] Create a single worksheet containing a table with the following columns: 
- Date 
- Category 
- Description 
- Amount 
- Payment Method 
Format the columns as an Excel table and assign the name "MainTable". Add 10 empty rows to the table.

[STEP] Format cells Number as follows:  
- Column A as a date (YYYY/MM/DD) 
- Column B as text
- Column C as text
- Column D as currency with symbol $
- Column E as text

[STEP] Add a row below Amount and out of the table for total Expenses, calculated as the sum of all the Amounts.

[STEP] Apply the following style to the table MainTable:
First row:
- Set the text to bold
- Set the text color to black
- Set the background color to light grey
- Align text to the center
Other rows:
- Align text to the left for text columns and right for numeric columns
- Set the background color to white for all the cell starting from the second row
Borders:
- Apply thin black borders
