Consider an Excel table named MainTable representing sales, with the following columns: Transaction ID, 
Date of Sale, 
Product ID, 
Product Name, 
Quantity Sold, 
Unit Price, 
Total Sale Amount, 
Payment Method, 
Store Location, 
Customer Type. 

Write a VBA macro that analyzes the dataset and automatically highlights high and low sales based on a user-defined threshold.

Request User Input: The macro should prompt the user to enter two thresholds:
A high threshold to identify high sales.
A low threshold to identify low sales.
Apply Conditional Formatting:
Cells with sales above the high threshold should be highlighted in green.
Cells with sales below the low threshold should be highlighted in red.
Preserve the Original Data: The macro should update only the formatting without modifying the original data.
